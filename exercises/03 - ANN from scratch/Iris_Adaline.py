Adaline cost visualization
Use the Iris Adaline example from the 2019.09.16 lecture and visualize
the cost as a function of the Adaline weights for each epoch/iteration:
- Modify adaline.py to accumulate the weights (w_) associated with each of
  the cost values.
- Use 3D plotting from matplotlib 
  (https://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/tutorial.html)
  to plot the cost values as a function of the weights from adaline.
